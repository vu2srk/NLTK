# Sentiment Analysis using Python's NLTK

> The purpose of this implementation is to classify a piece of information (product reviews in this case) as either positive or negative. Data sets can be found [here](http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html)

> About 700 positive and 700 negative reviews are used to train the classifier. Naive Bayes is the classification algorithm. Python's NLTK is the library used. 

Given a set of hypotheses H, and a classifier X,

P(X|H) = P(X)P(H|X) / P(H)
